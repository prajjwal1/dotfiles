# What is this?
These are my shell configuration dotfiles. The primary goal is to increase CLI productivity on Linux, though many scripts run just fine on any POSIX implementation.

# Inspirations
The contents of this repo have been partly invented from scratch, partly inspired by open source projects, and partly refactored from snippets from colleagues and friends. Many are attributed.

## Acquire the Repo
```shell
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/prajjwal1/Scrabble
```

# Contributions
